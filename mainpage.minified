For this to work, you will need to provide an API-Key from <a href=https://account.guildwars2.com/applications target=_blank>your account page</a>. The API-Key only needs account permissions and has to include <code>wvwbot</code> in the name.<h3>And behind the scenes?</h3><p>This bot will save your Discord ID and your API-Key. If you want to add another API-Key, simply fill out this form again with the new key. If you want to delete everything the bot knows about you, either delete every API-Key that you gave to the bot on your account page and wait some time or fill out this form with <code>deletemydata</code>.<h3>I transfered to another world, what now?</h3><p>Your roles get updated whenever you enter a new API-Key and every 24h. If you just changed your world and want your server roles updated, wait about 10 minutes for the API to update and then fill in this form <code>syncnow</code>. Your roles should get updated soon then.<h3>Can I have it on my own server?</h3><p>If you want to invite this bot to your own Discord server, click <a href=/invite target=_blank>here</a>. Only give it the permission to manage nicknames if you wish that the usernames will be overwritten with their account names.<h3>Login with discord? Are you trying to steal my password?</h3><p>Don't worry. When you click on this button, you will see exactly what the bot will be able to see if you choose to let it. The bot will only ask for your ID so it can remember you.</p><br><form action=/login>API-Key:<br><input name=key><br><br><input value="Login with Discord"type=submit style=font-size:15px></form><br><form action=/login><input value=syncnow style=display:none name=key> <input value="Sync now"type=submit></form><br><br><form action=/login><input value=deletemydata style=display:none name=key> <input value="Delete all my data"type=submit style=color:#000;background-color:red></form>
