    <h2>WvW Bot</h2>

    <h3>What is it for?</h3>
    <p>This bot will assign you roles on Discord based on your WvW world. For this to work, you will need to provide an
        API-Key
        from
        <a href="https://account.guildwars2.com/applications" target="_blank">your account page</a>. The API-Key only
        needs account permissions and has to include
        <code>wvwbot</code> in the name.</p>
    <h3>And behind the scenes?</h3>
    <p>This bot will save your Discord ID and your API-Key. If you want to add another API-Key, simply place your new
        key in
        the box below. If you want to delete everything the bot knows about you, press
        <code>Delete all my data</code>.</p>
    <h3>I transfered to another world, what now?</h3>
    <p>Your roles get updated whenever you enter a new API-Key and every 24h. If you just changed your world and want
        your server
        roles updated, either wait up to 24h or press
        <code>Sync now</code> below. After, your roles will be updated.</p>
    <h3>Can I have it on my own server?</h3>
    <p>If you want to invite this bot to your own Discord server, click
        <a href="/invite" target="_blank">here</a>. Only give it the permission to manage nicknames if you wish that
        the usernames will be overwritten with
        their account names.</p>
    <h3>Login with discord? Are you trying to steal my password?</h3>
    <p>Don't worry. When you click on this button, you will see exactly what the bot will be able to see if you choose
        to let
        it. The bot will only ask for your ID so it knows who you are.</p>
